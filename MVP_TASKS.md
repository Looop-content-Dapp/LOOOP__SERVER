# LOOOP SERVER - MVP DEVELOPMENT TASKS

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Scope Definition

## ðŸš¨ Critical Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Always use proper types, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
2. **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks and proper error responses
3. **Validation**: Validate all inputs using express-validator
4. **Logging**: Log all important operations and errors
5. **Testing**: Write tests for all new features

### Database Guidelines
1. **Migrations**: Always use Prisma migrations for schema changes
2. **Relationships**: Properly define and use Prisma relationships
3. **Indexing**: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
4. **Soft Deletes**: Consider soft deletes for important data

### Security Checklist
- [ ] All passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to all public endpoints
- [ ] File uploads are validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection protection (Prisma provides this)
- [ ] XSS protection with helmet
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### API Design Standards
1. **RESTful Design**: Follow REST conventions
2. **Consistent Responses**: Use standardized response format
3. **Status Codes**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes
4. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for list endpoints
5. **Filtering**: Add filtering and sorting capabilities

### File Structure Rules
1. **Controllers**: Keep controllers thin, move business logic to services
2. **Services**: Create service files for complex business logic
3. **Middleware**: Create reusable middleware for common functionality
4. **Types**: Define proper TypeScript interfaces in `types/` folder
5. **Utilities**: Create utility functions for reusable code

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. Pull latest changes from main branch
2. Create feature branch for each task
3. Write tests first (TDD approach when possible)
4. Implement feature
5. Run linting and formatting: `npm run lint:fix && npm run format`
6. Run tests: `npm test`
7. Commit with clear message
8. Push and create PR

### Before Each Commit
```bash
# Check code quality
npm run lint
npm run format

# Run tests
npm test

# Check build
npm run build

# Verify database schema
npm run db:generate
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and services
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
3. **Database Tests**: Test database operations
4. **Authentication Tests**: Test auth flows thoroughly
