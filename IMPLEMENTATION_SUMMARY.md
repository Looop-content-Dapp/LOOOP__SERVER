# Step 3: User Avatar Endpoints & Controller Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Avatar Upload & Delete Endpoints
- **POST /api/v1/user/avatar** - Upload user avatar
- **DELETE /api/v1/user/avatar** - Remove user avatar

### 2. Controller Flow Implementation
✅ **Image Validation**: 
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- File size limit (5MB)
- Image transformation (400x400, face-cropped)

✅ **Uploader Integration**:
- Cloudinary storage with multer
- Async upload handling
- Error handling for upload failures

✅ **Database Updates**:
- Updates `User.image` field with secure URL
- Removes old avatar from Cloudinary when uploading new one
- Proper cleanup on avatar deletion

✅ **Operation Logging**:
- Comprehensive logging for upload/delete operations
- Error logging with context

### 3. Username Change Restriction (30-day limit)
✅ **Enhanced `updateUserProfile` function**:
- Added `lastUsernameChangeAt` field to User model
- Validates 30-day restriction before allowing username changes
- Updates timestamp only when username actually changes
- Provides clear error messages with next available change date

### 4. Standardized Response Format
✅ **All responses follow consistent format**:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Operation description",
  "data": { ... },
  "error": { "message": "Error details" } // Only on failures
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Avatar Upload Flow
1. Receive multipart/form-data with 'avatar' field
2. Validate file type and size
3. Upload to Cloudinary (avatars folder)
4. Transform image (400x400, face-cropped)
5. Delete existing avatar if present
6. Update user record with new image URL
7. Return success response with user data

### Avatar Delete Flow
1. Verify user has existing avatar
2. Extract public_id from avatar URL
3. Delete from Cloudinary
4. Update user record (set image to null)
5. Return success response

### Username Change Protection
1. Check if username is actually changing
2. Verify last change was >30 days ago
3. Update `lastUsernameChangeAt` timestamp
4. Prevent frequent username changes

## 🧪 Testing Endpoints

### Avatar Upload
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/user/avatar \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "avatar=@/path/to/image.jpg"
```

### Avatar Delete
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/v1/user/avatar \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Profile Update (with username restriction)
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/v1/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "newusername"}'
```

## 🔒 Security Features
- File type validation
- File size restrictions
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- 30-day username change cooldown
- Input sanitization
- Cloudinary secure URLs

## 📊 Database Changes
- New field: `User.lastUsernameChangeAt` (DateTime, nullable)
- Migration applied successfully
- Prisma client regenerated

## ✨ Response Examples

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Avatar uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user123",
